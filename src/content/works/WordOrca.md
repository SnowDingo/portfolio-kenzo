WordOrca is a free flashcard app that is designed for comprehensive learning. This app was submitted to アプリ甲子園(2024) as a summer project.

I used....


1. Next.js
2. React
3. Ant design
4. Figma
5. Firebase

to create a full stack application.

I learned how to create functional app while maintaining deadline.
